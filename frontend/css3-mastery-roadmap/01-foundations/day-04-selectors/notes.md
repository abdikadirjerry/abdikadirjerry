STEP 6: SELECTORS (DEEP DIVE, VERY IMPORTANT)
Beginner
p {}
.box {}
#header {}

Intermediate

Combinators:

.card p {}
ul > li {}


Pseudo-classes:

:hover
:focus
:nth-child()


Pseudo-elements:

::before
::after

Advanced (critical thinking)

Avoid over-specific selectors

Prefer classes

IDs increase specificity → harder to override

Good CSS is easy to change later.
